Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub, created Jekyll as a static site generator written in Ruby. It is distributed under the MIT license. It can be used to build easy-to-use websites with rich and easy-to-use navigation, just like content management systems like Drupal and WordPress.

> “Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.” – Jekyll's "README" file
