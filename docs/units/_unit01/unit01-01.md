*What are Ruby, Jekyll and GitHub Pages?*
<!--more-->

# What is Ruby?

Known for its flexibility and support for multiple paradigms, Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Ruby uses [just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation){:target="_blank"} in conjunction with dynamic typing and garbage collection.

You can find more information about Ruby on [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org){:target="_blank"} and [ruby-doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org){:target="_blank"}.


## Gems
A Ruby package is called a **gem** They act like libraries and can be stalled via the command line. Over 170,000 Ruby gems are hosted by [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org){:target="_blank"}. Many new and existing Ruby libraries are also hosted on GitHub.

# What is Jekyll?
The static website generator Jekyll is a Ruby gem written in Ruby.

A static site generator automates the process of coding [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML){:target="_blank"} pages and makes them ready for serving to users ahead of time using raw data and a set of templates. Static site generators let users easily create full-featured static [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML){:target="_blank"} websites.

## What is Markdown?
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} lets users write using a simple plain text format and convert it to structurally valid [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML){:target="_blank"}. It's an easy-to-use text-to-HTML tool for web writers.

Markdown can be written in every text editor like Notepad or even Word. One of the most used text editors is Atom. Here is why:

### Atom
Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control. Atom's default packages can apply syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages and file formats.

Syntax highlighting is the ability of a computer program to display certain words and character combinations in a text in different colors, fonts and styles depending on their meaning. Syntax highlighting improves the readability of texts: structures in the text are easier to recognize, "cross-reading" is simplified, comments appear separated from the actual code and typos are noticed more quickly, since in many cases a typo leads to a changed display.

To come back to Jekyll renders [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} or textile templates and produces a complete static website that can be served via a web server.

Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages.

# What is Github Pages?
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free static web hosting service offered by [GitHub](https://github.com/) that allows users to create websites based on their GitHub repositories. It is for hosting user blogs, project documentation, or even whole books created as a page.

## What is Github?
*GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)*

Further Information about Github see the [Base R Course](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/unit99/sl02_github.html){:target="_blank"}.

*All GitHub Pages content is stored in a Git repository, either as files served to visitors verbatim or in Markdown format. GitHub is seamlessly integrated with Jekyll static web site and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure. As with the rest of GitHub, it includes both free and paid tiers of service, instead of being supported by web advertising. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)*
